Project Description: 
Goal tracker that allows users to create, update, and delete goals. It will also allow users to interact with goals submitted by other users through comments.  


New Programming Concept(s) I'm Planning to Learn: 
I never got to implement login and registration during the stack. I also did not get a chance to really implement a like button button. I would also like to see how different models interact with each other in an application. I would also like to try and implement more components in React to attempt more styling (I am admittedly not very comfortable with React, but will try).


Product Backlog (If I have more time after completing my MVP, I'll start to work on...)
* I am not entirely sure how to do a like button at this very moment, but would like to try. I also might want to attempt some kind of additional middleware in addition to auth to make sure users only have access to stuff they created.
